TCGA-OV histopathology data download
Cancer studies done based on tissue images for a particular cancer type generates Whole Slide Images, which generates data that is several Gigabytes in size as they contain much biological information which can be better analyzed with the use of deep learning models. We used HistomicsTK, an open-source software, to download and process TCGA-OV histopathology data from the GDC Data Portal. The GDC Data Portal had 107 SVS image files for Ovarian Cancer. HistomicsTK is a Python, and REST API developed for the analysis of histopathology whole-slide images in association with clinical and genomic data. HistomicsTK provides algorithms for fundamental image analysis tasks such as color normalization, color deconvolution, cell-nuclei segmentation, and feature extraction. HistomicsTK uses the `large_image` library to read and various microscopy image formats. It was installed using the following code.
$ sudo pip3 install large_image
$ sudo pip3 install pandas
$ sudo pip3 install matplotlib
$ sudo pip3 install skimage
$ git clone https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/HistomicsTK.git
$ cd HistomicsTK
$ sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements_dev.txt
$ sudo pip3 install -e . 
We modified two python scripts that were a part of the HistomicsTK package according to our datasets which were SVS files. This was done in two parts. One part was to split a whole image into different tiles so as to extract features from each cell of the tissue image. For this, the input is the TCGA.svs image and the output is the split images obtained from the TCGA.svs image. The second part was to extract cell features of each cell for which the input was each split image and the output was the seven features for each cell in the split images for the whole tissue slide. We could extract seven features for each cell for the whole image. The seven types of morphological and spatial features of cell nuclei were: major axis length (Major_Axis), minor axis length (Minor_Axis), the ratio of major to minor axis length (Ratio), nuclear area (Area), mean distance to neighboring cells(Mean_Distance),maximum distance to neighboring cells (Max_Distance), and minimum distance to neighboring cells (Min_Distance) and can be summarized as nucleic area (Area), nucleic shape (Major_Axis, Minor_Axis, and Ratio), and cell density (Mean_ Distance, Max_Distance and Min_Distance). These morphological features were then correlated with RNAseq data and CPTAC datasets.
